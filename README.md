# huggleCare Solution

## Dataset

Dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sandeepKondaveeti/huggleCare/blob/main/corona_tested_individuals_ver_006.english.csv).

## Approach
1. Importing the libraries and data.
2. Analyse the features, Feature Extraction.
3. Preprocessing and Cleaning.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Train and Test split Dataset and Imbalance dataset.
6. Hypermater tuning with multiple Models.
8. Conclude model with better results.

## Code

The code used in this project is inside **huggleCare.ipynb**.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

## Conclusion

After analysing the features provided, dropped some of the features which either have more NAs. Drawn relevant insights from our **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and modelled the data over various classification algorithms with combination of hypermareters and clearly see that **Random Forest Classifer and Gradient Boosting classifier** provides the best result with a **Accuracy** of **89.7%**
